<p class="homepage-subheading hx:font-medium" style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">Alongside the next Yukon territorial election, we’re having a plebiscite on electoral reform in the Yukon. <span class="hx:font-semibold">Vote YES for a more awesome Yukon</span>.</p>


## What’s happening?

When the next Yukon election takes place, eligible voters will also be able to choose “Yes” or “No” on an electoral reform plebiscite question. 

The question asks if voters want to change to a ranked vote system – where you rank your choice of candidates in order – or to stick with the current first-past-the-post voting system, which everyone agrees is [pretty terrible](https://sboots.ca/2025/08/20/in-support-of-the-yukon-electoral-reform-plebiscite/#what-s-happening).

**If you want to change, vote yes! If you want to stick with first-past-the-post, vote no.**

You can find out more on [Elections Yukon’s plebiscite page](https://electionsyukon.ca/en/plebiscite), or in their [plebiscite explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjM1tPb4wAI).


## Why vote yes?


### Show Canada that electoral reform is possible

The Yukon is an awesome role model for so many things. People across Canada have suggested replacing first-past-the-post [for years](https://sboots.ca/2025/08/20/in-support-of-the-yukon-electoral-reform-plebiscite/), and no other province or territory has been able to make it happen. We could be the first, and help [improve politics across the country](https://sboots.ca/2025/08/20/in-support-of-the-yukon-electoral-reform-plebiscite/#why-it-s-good-for-canada).


### Create better political outcomes

The [Yukon Citizens’ Assembly on electoral reform](https://www.yukoncitizensassembly.ca/) chose ranked vote because it [makes more votes matter](https://www.yukon-news.com/news/yukon-citizens-assembly-recommends-changing-electoral-system-to-ranked-vote-7533608) than first-past-the-post. Ranked vote [allows](https://www.yukon-news.com/news/yukon-citizens-assembly-recommends-changing-electoral-system-to-ranked-vote-7533608) “voters to vote for who they truly want, and it opens the door to smaller parties and independent candidates getting voted in”. 

As the Citizens’ Assembly report [pointed out](https://www.yukoncitizensassembly.ca/ycaer-final-report-october-2024/), “with Ranked Vote, voters can honestly rank their choices without feeling their vote is wasted”. That’s pretty awesome!


### Choose a great option for Yukon

The Yukon is a small territory and elections tend to be pretty tight (remember when there was [an exact tie](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-election-tie-explained-1.5985532)?). Ranked vote keeps the local accountability and representation we have right now, while better reflecting people’s views without anyone feeling like their vote is wasted.

Although there are lots of great electoral reform options out there (including [proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation), which is excellent), many of these work best on a country-sized scale rather than [a population of 48,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon).

[Everyday Yukoners from across the territory](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/video/9.6861539) who were part of the Citizens’ Assembly – not politicians or government officials! – landed on ranked vote as the best option to improve our electoral system.


### Political parties think it’s a good idea, even if they won’t admit it

Canadian political parties at both the federal and provincial levels [already use ranked vote to choose their party leadership candidates](https://fairvote.org/new-canadian-prime-minister-will-be-chosen-with-ranked-choice-voting/). It helps choose representatives that more supporters can get behind, and ultimately helps the party leadership better reflect their membership. 


### Be part of a really cool change

It would be awesome for Yukon to be the first Canadian territory or province to adopt an alternative to first-past-the-post. Past Canadian prime ministers [wish they’d done it](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-electoral-reform-biggest-regret-1.7426407). We could actually be the first to pull it off, and you can be part of making it happen.


## Why vote no?

Here’s some reasons to vote no (these are tongue-in-cheek!).

* You’re a current Yukon politician or political staffer, and you want to keep things the same so it’s easier to get re-elected.
* You think politics in Canada is working *totally fine* the way it is.
* Your favourite colour is beige.
* You don’t like nice things.
* You wish all these over-enthusiastic young kids would get off your dang lawn.


## Support the Vote YES Yukon campaign

We’re not affiliated with any Yukon political party or organization, and we’re just doing this because we think electoral reform is really cool.

If you’d like to support the campaign, that would be awesome!


### Print off a poster

Here are some posters that you can print off (~~on your work printer~~ at a local office supply store), in 11x17 ledger/tabloid size. If you have ideas for other poster designs, give us a shout at [voteyesyukon@gmail.com](mailto:voteyesyukon@gmail.com). 


### Donate to our lawn sign fund

Lawn signs are surprisingly expensive (like $10 apiece to print!). If you donate $10 or more before our planned print run, we’ll make sure to get you a lawn sign (we’re still figuring out shipping options for outside of Whitehorse). 

#### Some quick donation requirements:

* You can send donations by e-transfer to [voteyesyukon@gmail.com](mailto:voteyesyukon@gmail.com).
* If you’ve donated and you’d like a lawn sign, fill out our lawn sign request form (coming soon).
* **We are not a political party and these donations are not tax deductible.**
* For transparency, your name (as displayed in the e-transfer) will be added to a publicly-visible donation record spreadsheet.
* Please only send a donation if you are a Yukon resident, and please don’t donate more than $200.
* If for any reason we’re unsure about you or your donation, we’ll refund it back to you via e-transfer.
* If we have any donation funds left over after the election, we’ll donate them to the [Samara Centre for Democracy](https://www.samaracentre.ca/), which does awesome work to promote civic engagement in Canada. 

You can request a lawn sign without making a donation, with our lawn sign request form (coming soon). We’ll get these to people in first-come, first-serve order, using any additional donation funds we receive. (Not first-past-the-post order! That was a joke.) If you donate more than $10, you’re helping print lawn signs for other Vote YES Yukon supporters, which is super nice!

For public transparency, you can see who donated to Vote YES Yukon here (coming soon), and you can see our expenses here (coming soon). These are updated on a weekly basis. 


### Tell your friends to vote YES

The best thing you can do is tell your friends, family, coworkers, neighbours, secret archrivals, annoying relatives, and anyone else you know to vote YES for electoral reform!

It’s a niche topic that almost no one cares about, but it’s such a great opportunity to make our territory better. Letting folks know that it’s happening, and that voting YES is a good idea, will make a big difference.

You can share our website link ([voteyesyukon.ca](https://voteyesyukon.ca)) or Facebook page (coming soon) with anyone who is interested.
